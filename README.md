# Board Game Tracker - Rails
***

## Elevator Pitch
I often have trouble remembering I've introduced a specific friend to a great game that I've found.
With this app, I can keep track of who has played which game and what games we might want to try out.

## Project Requirements
* Easy web interface

## Feature List
* Enter information about games in your library
* Create a list of people who played a specific game
* Look at least/most played games
* Suggest games to play with a specific person

## Interesting Queries/Reports
* Suggesting frequently played games for players who haven't seen the game before.

## External Data Sources
* Board Game Geek XML API
